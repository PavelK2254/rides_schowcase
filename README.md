   cd rides_showcase
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh

3. **Set up the Google Maps API key:**
    - Create a `keys.json` file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add your Google Maps API key to the `keys.json` file in the following format:
      ```json
      {
        "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
      ```

4. **Run the application:**

   ```

## Project Structure

    - `feature/`: Contains the different features of the application.
        - `main_flow/`: Main flow of the application.

## Usage

### Booking a Ride

1. Open the application.
2. Enter the pickup and drop-off locations.
3. Select the ride type and passenger amount.
4. Confirm the booking.

### Viewing Ride Summary

1. Navigate to the ride summary screen.
2. View the details of the booked ride, including pickup and drop-off locations, ride type, and passenger amount.

## Running Tests

To run the unit and widget tests, use the following command:

```

## API Key Configuration

To use the Google Maps API, you need to provide a valid API key. The API key should be stored in a `keys.json` file and passed to the application using the `--dart-define-from-file` flag.

Example `keys.json` file:
```json
{
  "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

Run the application with the API key:
```sh
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=keys.json
```
